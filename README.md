# DigiCount (previously Census-Taking-Tool)
A simple web application utilizing Django as a back-end framework that is used to capture data (of details of every person in a household) and store it in a database. This is made to: 1) assist census workers on their jobs and, 2) in fulfillment of our project for CPE 009 (Object-oriented Programing).

This project was used again to fulfill our project for CPE 011 (Database Management) and refined the database aspect of the back-end. 

This project was once again used for CPE 020 (Methods of Research) as a prototype and added the data analytics page.

The project is deemed finished by the current author.
