# OOP-Project
A very barebones website that is used to capture data (usually a family) and store it in a database. This is made to: 1) assist census workers on their jobs and, 2) in fulfillment of our project for CPE 009.
This project was used again to fulfill our project for CPE 011 and refined the database aspect of the back-end.
