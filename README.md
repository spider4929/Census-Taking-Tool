# OOP-Project
A barebones website utilizing Django as a back-end framework that is used to capture data (of details of every person in a household) and store it in a database. This is made to: 1) assist census workers on their jobs and, 2) in fulfillment of our project for CPE 009 (Object-oriented Programing).
This project was used again to fulfill our project for CPE 011 (Database Management) and refined the database aspect of the back-end. This project is deemed finished and the project is archived.
